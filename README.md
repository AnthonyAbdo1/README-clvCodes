My Projects Experience

The first thing I did was change the text in the heading which was easy enough to find due to the class name. Once I removed the origional text I inserted the new text in between the brackets opening and closing tags.

The next step was to alter the text of the placeholder in the textbox. Just like in step one once the class and assosiated text was located it was just a matter of replacing it with something else in between the tags.

For the step involving adding a picture to the background I first considered having the image tagged as a background image but once I saw how the image looked like I changed the image to apear directly in the HTML code and not the CSS.

With the task of changing the color of the button on hovor I first had to find it in the CSS style section of the document. The color was placed under the class name of the button inside of curly brackets in the "<style>" section inside the "<head>" section. To change the color all that was need to do was remove the text from between the colon and the semi-colon and replace it with another color name.

Changing the font style in the body involved looking for the body class in the CSS, and then adding the code "font-family:sanse-serif;"

Steps six and seven both involved making a link that when clicked would take you to another page. The '<a href ="">' tag is used in this instance. You can copy and paste the link of the site you wish to go to within the perenthasis. 

When asked to change the border radius all that was needed was to go to the CSS style section and find the class of the button. Since it already had a border set for it all that was needed was to add the border-radius property and set it to in this case 20px.  

The Alert box was a bit tricky. I had to really look hard at the code to know were to insert the alert box. After finding some helpfull tips online on proper javascript coding I was succesfull in adding the alert box message to my page.
